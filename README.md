# packet-sniffer

Trying to create a packet sniffer for my laptop using Go, mainly to get better at Go and get familiar with the network package

Make sure you have Go installed on your local machine and clone the repo
In the main directory, run 'go build' and then ./main
This will give you a dump of the HTTP layer of packets leaving your local machine,
Eventually, will be able to do that for all devices on the network!
